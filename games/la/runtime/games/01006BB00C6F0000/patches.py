# The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (01006BB00C6F0000): the rewriter's patches of this game's own builds. dm/tools/patch_nso.py loads every profile's patches.py and applies those of a module's NSO build ID;

  # The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening 1.1.0 (v131072) main: the physics step (main+0x15730, main thread) rebuilds each world's PhysX completion task in place
  # (a PxLightCpuTask at world+0xc8) and passes it to simulate. A worker runs it (main+0x10ccf80: fetchResults, world+0x1d8 done = 1, notify, unlock) and then calls its
  # release (main+0x10cd070), which calls the task's own destructor: vtable back to the PxLightCpuTask base, mTm = 0 (main+0x10cced0). At 30 fps the game steps twice
  # per frame (step, wait, step, wait); the unlock hands the world's mutex to the woken main thread, and when the worker is descheduled there the main thread's
  # next step rebuilds the task before the late destructor runs, which then wipes the new task. The next simulation's NpSceneCompletion::release reads its mTm = 0:
  # crash at main+0x10ccf28 (lr main+0x13c236c; seen on the iPhone and in 2 of 5 Mac runs, in every Mac run under CPU load). On the Switch the release follows the
  # unlock within nanoseconds. The release becomes a plain ret: the destructor only resets the vtable and mTm (no resources), the step rebuilds every field, and this
  # release is used by this one vtable (main+0x1c51308 slot 7) only
